# Menox-s-macroboard

This is my personal Macroboard controlled by a XIAO R2040. I redid it multiple times and this is the final version I am quite proud of. thanks to @Simon who helped me alot and thanks to whom I was able to improve my skills drasticly.
It got 9 keys, each with RGB-LEDs, a rotary encoder and a 0.91 OLED. This macroboard will be used to improve my workflow and just add more features to my setup.

Schematic: 
This is the schematic. I split all the seperate components into diffrent wiring groups:

PCB:
This is how I connected everything. It´s a little bit messy but I tried to keep it as straight forward as possible, only used 4 vias in the whole projekt and added a little bit of spongebob art.
In case you are wondering about the setup: The XIAO is mounted on the back so the OLED can be placed right above it on the frontside

Case:
This is the case I came up with. It has a layer to mount the switches and one to hide the OLEDs parts that I dont want to be seen.
